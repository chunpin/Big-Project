Hi Basti, due to the internet router damaged. Today I will have to do update by SMS. so today I worked on Passfoto site on local server Maschine , what I have done are: 


• optimize the loading speed of site.

• optimize the usability by implementing the hover triggering to show tab-content.(no click needed);

• implement the Date calculating re-format on message section, (auto calculating how long the message has been left. the Years, Months, Weeks, And days based on the writting system in german, *Singlaize or Pluralize the unit based on the numbers*)

• re-CSS for the tab-content price tag

• re-structure HTML to be more SEO Friendly

• ready to move entire codebase into React (for future fast-pace-maintanice )


to make it easier to understand, I will report it again with the screenshot next week. On next Monday I will go to Rosenheim to buy a new router at Telekom.
So that's all for now, as always, thanks for taking time to read the message. Please have a great weekend. James
